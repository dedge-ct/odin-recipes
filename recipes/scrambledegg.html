    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup low-fat Cottage Cheese</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Cooking Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather your ingredients: cottage cheese, eggs, salt, pepper, and something to grease the pan (butter, coconut oil, and/or non-aerosol cooking spray will all work).</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients: To a small bowl, add the eggs, cottage cheese, salt, and pepper. Whisk until well combined and incorporated. </li>
        <li>Prepare the pan: Coat a nonstick skillet with a small amount of cooking oil and turn the heat to medium-low. Pour the egg mixture into the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs: Slowly cook the eggs using a rubber spatula to gently scramble them until light, fluffy curds begin to form and the eggs are cooked through with a soft and creamy texture.</li>
        <li> Remove and serve: Remove while hot and serve with your favorite breakfast sides. Whole grain toast and fresh berries are delicious. If you'd like to build a low-carb breakfast, serve it with avocado and a side of breakfast sausage or turkey bacon.</li>
